Scanner for PHP.ini
===========================

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/psecio/iniscan.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/psecio/iniscan)

The Iniscan is a tool designed to scan the given php.ini file for common security practices
and report back results. Currently it is only for use on the command line and reports the
results back to the display for both Pass and Fail on each test.

*Installation*

Using Composer:

```
{
    "require": {
        "psecio/iniscan": "dev-master"
    }
}
```

The only current dependency is the Symfony console.

Additionally, you can install it outside of a project with the `global` functionality Composer provides. From
any directory you can use:

```
$ ./composer.phar global require "psecio/iniscan=dev-master"
$ ~/.composer/vendor/bin/iniscan
```

*Example usage:*

```
vendor/bin/iniscan scan --path=/path/to/php.ini
```


*Example results:*

```
Results for /private/etc/php.ini:
============
Status | Severity | Key                      | Description
----------------------------------------------------------------------
PASS   | ERROR    | session.use_cookies      : Must use cookies to manage sessions
FAIL   | WARNING  | session.cookie_domain    : It is recommended that you set the default domain for cookies.
FAIL   | WARNING  |                          : Path /tmp is world writeable

1 passing
2 failure(s)
```

#### Command line usage

*Iniscan* offers a few commands for both checking and showing the contents of your php.ini.

##### Scan

The `scan` command will be the most used - it runs the rules checks against the given ini file and reports back the results. For example:

```
vendor/bin/iniscan scan --path=/path/to/php.ini
```

If the path is omitted, *iniscan* will try to find it based off the current configuration (a "php -i" call). By default, this reports back both the pass and fail results of the checks. If you'd like to only return the failures, you can use the `fail-only` argument:

```
vendor/bin/iniscan scan --path=/path/to/php.ini --fail-only
```

The `scan` command will return an exit code based on the results:

- 0: No errors
- 1: Failures found


###### Scan Level Threshold
You can request the only scan for rules that are on or above a threshold:

```
vendor/bin/iniscan scan --path=/path/to/php.ini --threshold=ERROR
```

There are 3 levels you can use:
* WARNING
* ERROR
* FATAL (No rules uses that level at the moment)


##### Show

The `show` command lists out the contents of your `php.ini` file with a bit of extra formatting.

```
vendor/bin/iniscan show --path=/path/to/php.ini
```

##### List

The `list` command shows a listing of the current rules being checked and their related php.ini key.

```
vendor/bin/iniscan list
```

#### Output formats

By default *iniscan* will output information directly to the console in a human-readable result. You can also specify other output formats that may be easier to parse programatically (like JSON). Use the `--format` option to change the output:

```
vendor/bin/iniscan show --path=/path/to/php.ini --format=json
```

the `list` command also supports JSON output:

```
vendor/bin/iniscan list --path=/path/to/php.ini --format=json
```

**NOTE:** Currently, only the `scan` command supports alternate output formats - and only three: console, JSON and XML.


#### Contexts

The scanner also supports the concept of "contexts" - environments you may be executing the scanner in. For example, in your development environment, it may be okay to have `display_errors` on. In production, however, this is a bad idea. The scanner's default assumes you're using it in prod, so it uses the strictest checks unless you tell it otherwise. To do so, use the `context` command line option:

```
vendor/bin/iniscan show --path=/path/to/php.ini --context=dev
```

#### Deprecated reporting

As the scanner runs, it will compare the configuration key to a list of deprecated items. If the version is at or later than the version defined in the rules, an error will be shown in the output. For example, in the console, you'd see:

```
WARNING: deprecated configuration items found:
-> register_globals
It's recommended that these settings be removed as they will be removed from future PHP versions.
```

This is default behavior and does not need to be enabled.


In this case, we're told it we're running in dev, so anything that specifically mentions "prod" isn't executed.
